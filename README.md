Feel free to open an issue and I'll take a look.

Here's how the app works:

When the user clicks on each of the buttons, three giphys will show up on the page. 
The text buttons are qoutes of  famous people and the giphys are related to them. The first qoute is said by Al Pacino. The second one is said by 
Nelson Mandella.
